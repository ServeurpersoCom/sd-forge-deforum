# Deforum Stable Diffusion â€” official extension for Forge

This is the Deforum extension for the [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge).
It is a fork of [the Deforum Extension for A1111](https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-webui-deforum) and is expected to diverge over time.

## Current status

This extension is **experimental**. It should load and basic settings should work. However, the full surface area of Deforum has not yet been tested. 
You are encouraged to take it for a spin and [raise issues here](https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-forge-deforum/issues) as you find problems.

## Installation

After setting up the [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge):

    cd <forge_install_dir>/exensions
    git clone https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-forge-deforum
    cd sd-forge-deforum
    pip install -r requirements.txt
